<h2><u>Techniques in Soduku Puzzles (Jan 14, 2022)</u></h2>
<p><b>Summary:</b> I will show you the rules of sudoku, and then we will solve some puzzles that require various different techniques. 
    Although the grid appears to have numbers, you do not need any arithmetic to solve the puzzle; it is a logic puzzle rather 
    than a mathematical one. I recommend <a href="https://sudoku.simonton.app/" target="_blank">https://sudoku.simonton.app</a> 
    to save time and let you focus on the more interesting steps. </p>
<br>

<h2><u>Wallpaper Groups and Polyhedra (Dec 17, 2021)</u></h2>
<p><b>Summary:</b> First I will show you some art by M. C. Escher, and the mathematics behind them. Then I will explain what a wallpaper 
    group is, as well as a sketch of the proof that there are only 17 distinct ones. There is a simple way to determine what 
    symmetry group a given pattern has, and you can try it on anything that has some repeated part. I will also show you the 
    related theory of convex polyhedra with all faces being regular polygons, which surprisingly also has finitely many possibilities 
    (apart from some infinite sets). </p>

<h2><u>Flexagons (Dec 3, 2021)</u></h2>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Summary: I will show you how to make and use four distinct flexagons, as well as a way to "break" three of 
    them by twisting it to show a face that does not consist of a single label. Then I will explain a method that theoretically 
    allows you to construct two types of flexagons, with arbitrarily many faces. 
    <br>
    Flexagons were discovered in 1939 by Arthur Stone, a graduate student at Princeton, and since then many different forms of 
    flexagons were discovered. 
    <br>
    Please prepare a sheet of paper, some tape or reasonably quickly drying glue, a ruler and a pair of scissors. If you don't 
    want to use scissors during the lesson, cut some straight strips (lengthwise) from your piece of paper before the lesson, 
    but make sure they are not too wide: 1.6 cm wide strips will work certainly, but if it is much larger it might not be long 
    enough compared to the width. Alternatively, if you want larger flexagons, cut wider strips and join them together at the ends.</p>

<h2><u>Perplexing Puzzles (Nov 26, 2021)</u></h2>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Please prepare 2 straws and cut each into 4 portions of equal length (you only need 7 pieces in total). 
    You can also bring a piece of paper to try some of the games we will show you.</p>
<br>

<h2><u>Entertaining Mathematical Puzzles (Nov 19, 2021)</u></h2>
<p><b>Summary:</b> I will go over and generalize many more interesting puzzles by Martin Gardner and explain the theory behind 
    them which you will be able to apply to other puzzles of this sort, including a cool mathematical card trick that you can show 
    off to your friends!
    <br>
    Please print the PDF's below and follow the instructions in them before the lesson.
    <br>
    Also, prepare another piece of paper, or some fairly long slips of paper (cutting a thin strip from the edge of a piece of letter 
    or A4 paper should work), but the strips should not be too thin (you need to be able to easily cut it in half lengthwise).

<h2><u>The Magic of Martin Gardner (Nov 12, 2021)</u></h2>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Martin Gardner was the most popular writer of recreational mathematics of the last century, and this time 
    we selected several interesting puzzles and extended and generalized them. 
    <br>
    Bring 6 coins of the same size and 12 sticks of the same length; these sticks can be toothpicks, pencils, or anything else 
    that is thin and long.
</p>
<br>

<h2><u>Conway's Game of Life (Nov 5, 2021)</u></h2>
<p><b>Summary:</b> The process of the (0-player) game, a proof that it is Turing complete, and various interesting patterns 
    (and how to discover them). 
    <br>
    I will explain the cellular automaton's rules, and show you some simple patterns that have very different outcomes. 
    Then I will demonstrate the proof it is Turing complete (which, although impractical to construct manually, can be 
    proven to exist), including a demonstration of the first step. Finally, I will show you some interesting patterns that 
    have been constructed. 
    <br>
    You can explore this cellular automaton and a wide variety of variants with Golly, available at 
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/golly/files/latest/download" target="_blank">https://sourceforge.net/projects/golly/files/latest/download</a>
    (it runs on all operating systems). </p>
<br>

<h2><u>Variants of Fox and Geese (Oct 29, 2021)</u></h2>
<p><b>Summary:</b> The rules of one version, a minimal winning strategy, and similar strategies for some other variants.  
    <br>
    I will explain the rules of Fox and Geese, and show you a minimal winning strategy that only requires remembering 5 
    distinct positions (two more if the fox starts at a specific location). Then I will explain a theorem that implies the 
    geese still win if the fox can pass twice on the 8 by 8 board, or once on the 8 by infinity board, but not for any 
    larger amount. Then I will explain another game that uses a similar strategy, which is more balanced and easier to play 
    while having a simpler theory. At the end of the lesson, I will share an Olympiad problem that can be solved with some 
    ideas related to game theory.
    <br>
    You can play Fox and Geese at home on any 8 by 8 or larger board (I recommend letting the fox pass twice to make it more fair), 
    and you can also play the variants by drawing the board on paper. There is also a fairly good computer for the game at 
    <a href="http://www.lutanho.net/play/foxanddogs.html" target="_blank">http://www.lutanho.net/play/foxanddogs.html</a>,
    and also 
    <a href="http://www.lutanho.net/play/harehound.html" target="_blank">http://www.lutanho.net/play/harehound.html</a>
    for the other game.</p>
<br>

<h2><u>Domineering (Oct 22, 2021)</u></h2>
<p><b>Summary:</b> The rules, some (near optimal) strategy, and the theory of endgames. 
    I will explain the rules of Domineering, as well as some strategy that is useful in openings on rectangular grids. 
    In the endgame, the theory is much simpler, and I will explain some theory about how to evaluate positions and add them. 
    Then I will explain a variant with similar rules, which can also be analyzed with these techniques and has values that are 
    easier to add. I will also talk about some other games that use this method when analyzing endgames. 
    <br>
    You can play the game online against another player or a fairly strong computer at 
    <a href="https://staff.fim.uni-passau.de/kreuzer/Spielesammlung/Spielesammlung/Domineering/index.html" target="_blank">https://staff.fim.uni-passau.de/kreuzer/Spielesammlung/Spielesammlung/Domineering/index.html </a>
    or at home on any board (if you have dominoes that would be much easier to do but else you can just use arbitrary counters). </p>
<br>

<h2><u>Peg Solitaire (Oct 15, 2021)</u></h2>
<p><b>Summary:</b> The rules, a neat symmetrical solution and some theory of peg solitaire. 
    I will explain the rules and how to use the software below. Then I will show you a 19-move solution to the original puzzle 
    (the optimal is 18 moves), and a number of methods to solve many similar puzzles on similar boards. After this I will explain 
    the algebraic theory of these pegs as well as a hexagonal variant.  
    <br>
    To play the game, download 
    <a href="https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/java/solitaire/Solitaire.jar " target="_blank">https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/java/solitaire/Solitaire.jar  </a>
    and download java from Oracle. 
    Then open the file to make a peg solitaire problem yourself and solve it. To save a problem you have made, go to File -> 
    Save as, and you can upload a problem by sending the .slt file. The first problem I recommend you to do is attached below. 
    Place pegs at all of the yellow dots, and then repeatedly jump one peg over another, removing the one jumped over, so that at 
    the end there is only a peg at the center. </p>
<br>

<h2><u>Dots and Boxes I (Oct 8, 2021)</u></h2>
<p><b>Summary:</b> The rules, basic strategy and long chain rule in dots and boxes. 
    I will explain the rules, then pick some random users to try some sample games and explain the first step to playing 
    optimal dots and boxes. Then I will present the long chain rule and demonstrate how necessary it is in the game. After 
    this lesson, find someone to play with if you have not already and try to find a way to win more consistently than merely 
    using these strategies, then see how well your method works in Lesson 2. You can also try playing against Dabble or using it 
    to analyze your games.   
    <br>
    Dabble: 
    <a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~jpg/dabble/" target="_blank"> https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~jpg/dabble/</a>
    : download dabble.zip, extract it, then open the applications in it to play dots and boxes, also with analysis from the 
    computer. You will need to run it on a Windows computer. To share a game you played, save your game (as a .dbl file), go 
    to the Dabble folder, and upload the file (it will not be very large).
