    <b>John Horton Conway</b> once said: 
</p>
<p>
    <i>You get surreal numbers by playing games. I used to feel guilty in Cambridge that I spent all 
        day playing games, while I was supposed to be doing mathematics. Then, when I discovered 
        surreal numbers, I realized that playing games IS math. </i>

    <b>This platform's sole purpose</b> is for all who are interested in recreational mathematics 
    or mathematical puzzles to discuss these topics. The platform is for students to share, 
    learn and discuss, aiming to explore the beauty of mathematics. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>The name of this platform</b> refers to the monster group, the largest of the sporadic simple 
    groups, and <b>the logo</b> is the glider in Conway's Game of Life, which has simple rules but many 
    deep theorems, including that it is Turing complete (meaning that it is, in some sense, able 
    to perform any calculation any computer can do).
