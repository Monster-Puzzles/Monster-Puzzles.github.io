    John Horton Conway once said: 
</p>
<p>
    You get surreal numbers by playing games. I used to feel guilty in Cambridge that I spent all 
    day playing games, while I was supposed to be doing mathematics. Then, when I discovered 
    surreal numbers, I realized that playing games IS math.

    The name of this platform refers to the monster group, the largest of the sporadic simple 
    groups, and the logo is the glider in Conway's Game of Life, which has simple rules but many 
    deep theorems, including that it is Turing complete (meaning that it is, in some sense, able 
    to perform any calculation any computer can do).
