            <b>John Horton Conway</b> once said: 
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>You get surreal numbers by playing games. I used to feel guilty in Cambridge that I 
                spent all day playing games, while I was supposed to be doing mathematics. Then, 
                when I discovered surreal numbers, I realized that playing games IS math. </i>

            <b>This platform's sole purpose</b> is for all who are interested in recreational 
            mathematics or mathematical puzzles to discuss these topics. The platform is for students 
            to share, learn and discuss, aiming to explore the beauty of mathematics.

            <b>The name of this platform</b> refers to the monster group, the largest of the sporadic 
            simple groups, and <b>the logo</b> is the glider in Conway's Game of Life, which has 
            simple rules but many deep theorems, including that it is Turing complete (meaning that 
            it is, in some sense, able to perform any calculation any computer can do).
